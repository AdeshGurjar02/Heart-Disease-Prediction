# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project provides a web application for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The application uses a machine learning model to analyze various health metrics and predict whether a patient is at high risk for heart disease.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: A simple and user-friendly web interface for entering patient data.
- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Converts categorical features into one-hot encoded format to be used by the model.
- **Results Display**: Provides predictions with a clear message indicating high or low risk of heart disease.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning model training and prediction.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the web interface.
- **Python 3.10**: The programming language used for development.

## Installation
